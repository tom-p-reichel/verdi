synopsis: "Framework for verification of implementations of distributed systems in Coq"
description: """
Verdi is a Coq framework to implement and formally verify distributed systems.
Verdi supports several different fault models ranging from idealistic to realistic.
Verdi's verified system transformers (VSTs) encapsulate common fault tolerance
techniques. Developers can verify an application in an idealized fault model, and
then apply a VST to obtain an application that is guaranteed to have analogous
properties in a more adversarial environment.
